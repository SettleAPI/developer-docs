# Payment Request Outcome

The Payment Request Outcome endpoint shows the outcome info for a **Payment Request**, **ReAuth** or **Capture**.

This endpoints includes specified fee and/or interchange that will be deducted from payout, and also updated additional amount field if the user added gratuity.

If the callback URI registered for the payment request was secure (https), the contents of this form was sent along with the callback. If the callback URI was insecure, a notification pointing to this endpoint was sent instead.

The status field contains a simple string that is one of `ok`, `fail`, `auth`, or `pending`. The `status_code` field contains more information. The codes currently documented are:

| Code 	| Reason                                                  	| Status Code 	|
|:----:	|:--------------------------------------------------------	|:-----------:	|
| 1003 	| PENDING - Waiting for customer or bank                  	|   pending   	|
| 2000 	| OK - Payment received                                   	|      ok     	|
| 3008 	| AUTH - Payment authorized, ready for capture            	|     auth    	|
| 4004 	| NOT_FOUND - No such customer                            	|     fail    	|
| 4019 	| ABORTED - Merchant aborted payment before capture       	|     fail    	|
| 5006 	| REJECTED - Customer rejected/aborted payment request    	|     fail    	|
| 5011 	| REQUEST_EXPIRED - Payment request expired               	|     fail    	|
| 5012 	| AUTH_EXPIRED - Authorization not captured within 3 days 	|     fail    	|

::: tip NOTE
The list of status codes may grow in the future, and API clients should deal with unknown status codes gracefully. However, one can rely on **1xxx** and **3xxx** being temporary states *(merchant should wait for further updates)*, **2xxx** represent final successful outcomes, and **4xxx** and **5xxx** represents final failure outcomes.
