# QR Acceptance

When a user accesses a webshop through a browser on their phone, they obviously cannot use the phone to scan a QR code in order to pay with Settle! (Except via some sort of elaborate mirror setup... Perhaps Settle should go into hardware!) Thus we provide a JavaScript library that can be found here

<https://github.com/aukaio/settle.acceptance.js>

Using that library, either a QR code can be displayed (when on a desktop) or a button (when on a smartphone). When on a mobile browser, the button will start the Settle app and do the equivalent of scanning the QR code.
