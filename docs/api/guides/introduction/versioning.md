# Versioning

The current major version of the API is v1. Changes within a major version will always be backwards-compatible. New major versions may or may not be backwards compatible with the previous major version. Users will always be duly notified when we bump the major version, and of any changes that might affect backwards-compatibility. You can also refer to the changelog for the most recent updates to the API.
