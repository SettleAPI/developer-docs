# Settle API Docs

## Introduction

This is the repo for the [Settle API Documentation](https://developer.settle.eu/docs). It is buildt using [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/), a minimalistic Vue-powered static site generator from [Evan You](https://evanyou.me/), the creator of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

***TL;DR:*** *[Contributing and setting up local environment](#contributing)*

## VuePress

VuePress is composed of two parts: a [minimalistic static site generator](https://github.com/vuejs/vuepress/tree/master/packages/%40vuepress/core) with a Vue-powered [theming system](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/theme/) and [Plugin API](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/plugin/), and a default theme optimized for writing technical documentation. It was created to support the documentation needs of Vueâ€™s own sub projects.

Each page generated by VuePress has its own pre-rendered static HTML, providing great loading performance and is SEO-friendly. Yet, once the page is loaded, Vue takes over the static content and turns it into a full Single-Page Application (SPA). Extra pages are fetched on demand as the user navigates around the site.

## How It Works

A VuePress site is in fact a [SPA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA) powered by [Vue](http://vuejs.org/), [Vue Routerand](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router) and [webpack](http://webpack.js.org/). If youâ€™ve used Vue before, you will notice the familiar development experience when you are writing or developing custom themes (you can even use [Vue DevTools](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools) to debug your custom theme!).

During the build, we create a server-rendered version of the app and render the corresponding HTML by virtually visiting each route. This approach is inspired by [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/)'s `nuxt generate` command and other projects like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

Each [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) file is compiled into HTML with [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) and then processed as the template of a Vue component. This allows you to directly use Vue inside your Markdown files and is great when you need to embed dynamic content.
